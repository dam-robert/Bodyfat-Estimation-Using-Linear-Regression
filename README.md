# Bodyfat-Estimation-Using-Linear-Regression

This analysis estimates body fat percentage in men using a linear regression on various body part circumference measurements.


We wish to find a set of useful measurements to get a quick, cheap, and effective bodyfat percentage estimate that can be used as a rough proxy to the more acccurate, but expensive methodologies.


Model selection was done on measurements and performance evaluation and model diagnostics are performed.
